**Anagram**

     An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of a different word, for example state and taste are
     anagrams of each other, as are damned, demand and madden.

**How it works**

    Construct a function written in Python that, given a list of words, returns a dictionary whose keys are the letters
    of a word sorted into alphabetical order and whose values are lists of all the words with that key.
    
    **Example**
          
          A key-value pair might be:
          ‘aestt’: [‘state’, ‘taste’]

**Final Output**

   1) Find and print the anagram with the largest number of variants.
   2) Also find and print the longest pair of words that are anagrams of each other.
